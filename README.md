# Focus - Analytical Data Collection

In collaboration with a project ongoing at the National University of Singapore aiming to analyse and correlate the effect that “Distraction Apps” have on an individual’s productivity. Users who agree to participate in the study install an Android app which allows the them to set specified productivity period during which they intend to be studying or completing work. Whenever the user then accesses distraction apps including entertainment and social media during the set time, we record the frequency and time intervals of the distraction as well as the specific apps that have interrupted the productivity period. The data is compiled and posted to my server at the end of the day where I have created a PHP script to verify the user, validate the data, and store the data in a MySQL database with the MySQLi Extension. The structure for the database shown below was carefully designed so as to allow to any possible scenario of data to be recorded.
